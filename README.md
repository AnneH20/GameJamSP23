# GameJamSP23

My submission to Mississippi State University's Game Jam Spring 2023

The theme was "Change"

Video demonstration can be found here: https://youtu.be/w3NYKp0zIak

Note: please start with the volume down!

## Making Change

The goal of the game is to match the amount of money given.

Using various amounts of money (dollars and coins), select the correct combinations and increase your score!

This game aids with teaching kids (and adults) about counting currency.

## System Requirements
1. Unity
2. Windows or MacOS system

## How to Play
1. Use the + or - signs to increase or decrease the currency amount
2. Match the amount to the expected amount
3. Hit the "Submit" button and watch your score increase
4. As you progress, the expected amount gets bigger!
